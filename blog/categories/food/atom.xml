    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had leftover whey after <a href="/blog/2015/04/27/making-yogurt/">making yogurt</a>, so I made ginger ale.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I followed <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Lacto-fermented-Ginger-Ale/">this recipe</a>. (I also tried making ricotta cheese and it was a total fail: it never curdled.)</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<ul>
<li>It didn&rsquo;t do anything for 2 days, then it suddently showed signs of fermentation (namely, carbonation).</li>
<li>Next time, I&rsquo;ll bleed some CO2 as it goes. Maybe that would make it fizzier.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mix</h2>

<p>I used a 2-liter soda bottle because the contents would become very pressurized. These bottles are designed to handle it!</p>

<p>I mixed honey (1 &frac12; cups, yum), lemon juice, grated ginger, and a bit of whey:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ginger_ale/mix.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Then I filled it almost to the top with water, leaving some space for CO2.</p>

<p>Lactic acid bacteria in the whey will eat sugar from the honey and turn it into lactic acid, CO2, and a tiny bit of alcohol.</p>

<h2>Wait</h2>

<p>The recipe said &ldquo;3 to 7 days&rdquo;. I left it for 4 days. It pretty much looked like this the whole time:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ginger_ale/wait.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>(It&rsquo;s translucent and brown-ish, with little bubbles on the top.)</p>

<p>For the first 2 days, nothing happened. I was afraid it would be a failure like the ricotta.</p>

<p>On day 3, it was noticeably more pressurized.</p>

<p>By day 4, it was so pressurized that I thought it would explode in the kitchen, so I put it in the fridge.</p>

<p>It rested in the fridge for about 20 hours.</p>

<h2>Enjoy</h2>

<p>It turned out gingery, sweet, &amp; lightly carbonated:</p>

<p>Next time, I&rsquo;ll try to make it more carbonated. I might also add less lemon juice &amp; more ginger.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I tried making yogurt. It worked!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I based it on this great recipe: <a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/yogurt_making/YOGURT2000.htm">Dr. David Fankhauser&rsquo;s Yogurt</a>. Dr. Fankhauser has a <a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/CHEESE.html">ton of illustrated, detailed recipes</a> for other dairy and make-at home foods (eg, <a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Blue_Cheese/Blue_Cheese.htm">blue cheese</a>, <a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Buds_and_Bark/tapping_sugar_maple_index.html">maple syrup</a>, <a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/homesteading/popcorn_index.html">microwave popcorn</a>).</p>

<p>Some overall notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>My grocery store <em>doesn&rsquo;t carry</em> plain yogurt (except in giant containers), so I used <strong>greek yogurt as starter</strong>. It worked just fine.</li>
<li>The recipe called for 3 hours of culturing time, but I found <strong>longer (12-16 hours) was better</strong>.</li>
<li>I really fretted over the incubation temperature. I don&rsquo;t think that was necessary. I think <strong>set-it-and-forget-it would have been OK</strong>!</li>
<li>The resulting yogurt is as <strong>good</strong> as you can get at the store!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to using the <strong>whey</strong> (pickles, ginger ale, ricotta cheese).</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Setup</h2>

<p>First, scald the milk to kill any unwanted cultures that may have survived pasteurization:</p>

<p><img src="/images/yogurt/scalding-milk.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Sterilize equipment in boiling water:</p>

<p><img src="/images/yogurt/sterilize-equipment.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Unwanted cultures could give the yogurt a bad taste.</p>

<h2>Incubation</h2>

<p>Mix a cup of store-bought yogurt into the milk, then distribute it into jars.</p>

<p>Put the jars in a cooler with 120°F (50°C) water:</p>

<p><img src="/images/yogurt/incubation-jars.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>And let it sit:</p>

<p><img src="/images/yogurt/incubation.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I found longer was better. My longest was 16 hours and looked thick and good!</p>

<p>I was really fretting about the temperature: I occassionally scooped some water out, boiled it, then added it back. I think this was overkill!</p>

<h2>Result</h2>

<p>In the jar, the curds and whey separate:</p>

<p><img src="/images/yogurt/yogurt-in-jar.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>The whey can be decanted:</p>

<p><img src="/images/yogurt/jar-of-whey.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>(This is whey from a few jars of yogurt.)</p>

<p>Leaving only the yogurt curd:</p>

<p><img src="/images/yogurt/yogurt-curd-in-jar.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Yum! Smooth and creamy (after stirring), but unsweetened, so I add <a href="http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2011/03/06/hagelslag/">hagelslag</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/yogurt/yogurt-in-bowl.jpg" width="500"></p>

<h2>Next</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to using the &ldquo;leftover&rdquo; whey to make:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://immigrantstable.com/2013/11/17/whey-pickles/">whey pickles</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Lacto-fermented-Ginger-Ale/">ginger ale</a></li>
<li><a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Ricotta/ricotta_00.htm">ricotta</a> (also from Dr. Fankhauser)</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, in a few weeks I&rsquo;ll try to step up my game and try <a href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/neufchatel/neufchatel.htm">Dr. Fankhauser&rsquo;s neufchatel</a>, which adds rennet to the mix.</p>
